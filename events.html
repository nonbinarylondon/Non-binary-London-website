<h2>Next event: Sunday 19 August 2018</h2>

<p>The event description below is from Calu (event organiser).</p>

<p>Hey wonderful people,</p>

<p>I received lots of positive feedback after our previous focused discussion on gender so here we go again. I have organised a range of activities starting with a chat, then some time to hang out / meet one another and lastly a Queer Salsa session. You're welcome to drop in/out at any point.</p>

<p>Join us to share stories (feel free to be as cute and/or angry and/or soft and/or radical as you like) and meet other non-binary folk in London. Last time about 20-30 of us had a great super chilled afternoon just hanging out.</p>

<p>If you're worried/anxious about coming for the first time or coming alone, feel free to post in the group or the event page - last time a few new folk arranged to meet up and arrive together. We want our spaces to be welcoming, so let us know if there's anything we can do to make you more comfortable and make our event(s) more accessible and we'll try our best!</p>

<p>Non-binary is valid!</p>

<h4>Host</h4>

<p>This event is being hosted by Calu Lema (they/them) who you contact via <a href="mailto:queernewham@gmail.com?subject=nonbinary.london contact: 19 August event">queernewham@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Upcoming</h2>
<p>A few events are in the works, but dates are to be confirmed.</p>

<h2>Venue details</h2>
<p>In order to provide a (thin) layer of safety for our members, we don't provide venue details of events on the website (though where we are attending a public event, the venue can generally be found online pretty easily). In order to access venue details, you should join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nonbinarylondon" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> and/or the <a href="/mailing-list" target="_blank">mailing list</a>. Note that if you join the mailing list, you probably won't receive venue details for an event already listed on this page (as the email will most likely have already gone out). If you want to find out the venue of an event that was already listed here when you joined the mailing list, <a href="/contact"> get in contact</a>.
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>As much as possible, we organise events in places that have step-free access and that cater to vegan diets. We also endeavour for at least a substantial part of each meetup to be a free activity (excluding any food and drinks you choose to buy), and specify any ticket fees where they exist.</p>
<p>Get in contact if you have any suggestions for how we can make our events more accessible or if you'd like to come to a particular event and have specific accessibility needs - we'll try our best to accommodate.</p>
<h2>Previous events</h2>
<p>Here we will dump the details of previous events to allow visitors to get a feel for the kinds of in-person meetups we have. Events organised before the website was created (June 2018) are not included but can be found in the Facebook group.</p>
