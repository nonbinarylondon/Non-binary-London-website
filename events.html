<h2>Events on hold</h2>

<p>Given the ongoing COVID-19 situation we are not currently holding any meetups. We'll announce on this website, our <a href="/mailing-list" target="_blank">mailing list</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nonbinarylondon" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> when events resume.</p>

<p>In the meantime, recommendations for venues with good access and plenty of space in the East and West (as well other areas of London) are very welcome!</p>

<h2>Venue details</h2>
<p>In order to provide a (thin) layer of safety for our members, we don't provide venue details of events on the website (though where we are attending a public event, the venue can generally be found online pretty easily). In order to access venue details, you should join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nonbinarylondon" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> and/or the <a href="/mailing-list" target="_blank">mailing list</a>. Note that if you join the mailing list, you probably won't receive venue details for an event already listed on this page (as the email will most likely have already gone out). If you want to find out the venue of an event that was already listed here when you joined the mailing list, <a href="/contact"> get in contact</a>.
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>As much as possible, we organise events in places that have step-free access and that cater to vegan diets. We also endeavour for at least a substantial part of each meetup to be a free activity (excluding any food and drinks you choose to buy), and specify any ticket fees where they exist.</p>
<p>Get in contact if you have any suggestions for how we can make our events more accessible or if you'd like to come to a particular event and have specific accessibility needs - we'll try our best to accommodate.</p>

<h2>Previous events</h2>
<p>Here we will dump the details of previous events to allow visitors to get a feel for the kinds of in-person meetups we have. Events organised before the website was created (June 2018) are not included but can be found in the Facebook group.</p>
