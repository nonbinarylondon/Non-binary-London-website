<p><strong>Non-binary London and TransActive London: picnic + sport + games</strong></p>

<p><strong>Time:</strong> 14:00-17:00<br><strong>Location:</strong> just north of the Serpentine in Hyde Park (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3f1N9kq2fp4" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/maps/3f1N9kq2fp4</a>)<br><strong>Accessibility:</strong> wheelchair accessible; unfortunately the nearest public toilets are gendered<br><strong>Cost:</strong> free!</p>


<p class="before-list">An afternoon of activities (or non-activity, if your prefer!)! You can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>picnic (you can pot luck it or not - no pressure to share, particularly if you have specific dietary requirements)</li>
  <li>play a variety of sports, including skateboarding, football/kickabout, (mini) tennis and frisbee, and potentially fitness/workout activities</li>
  <li>play board/card games, including (but not limited to!) Cthulhu Fluxx, Citadels, Dixit, Funemployed and Sushi Go Party!</li>
  <li>just chill and/or chat!</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to bring your own games and sports equipment - we're very DIY (or DIO: do it ourselves)!</p>

<p>Note that we may be joined by trans women and men from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/transactivelondon" target="_blank">TransActive London: sport and exercise for trans people in London</a> since the skateboarding part has also been posted there (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1818833988211177" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/events/1818833988211177</a>). So by extension, for this specific event you're welcome to bring along trans friends, non-binary or not.</p>

<p>I'll (endeavour to) bring pronoun stickers as well as the Non-binary London banner to make it easier to find us!</p>

<h4>Host</h4>

<h2>Upcoming</h2>
<p>A few events are in the works, but dates are to be confirmed.</p>

<h2>Venue details</h2>
<p>In order to provide a (thin) layer of safety for our members, we don't provide venue details of events on the website (though where we are attending a public event, the venue can generally be found online pretty easily). In order to access venue details, you should join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nonbinarylondon" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> and/or the <a href="/mailing-list" target="_blank">mailing list</a>. Note that if you join the mailing list, you probably won't receive venue details for an event already listed on this page (as the email will most likely have already gone out). If you want to find out the venue of an event that was already listed here when you joined the mailing list, <a href="/contact"> get in contact</a>.
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>As much as possible, we organise events in places that have step-free access and that cater to vegan diets. We also endeavour for at least a substantial part of each meetup to be a free activity (excluding any food and drinks you choose to buy), and specify any ticket fees where they exist.</p>
<p>Get in contact if you have any suggestions for how we can make our events more accessible or if you'd like to come to a particular event and have specific accessibility needs - we'll try our best to accommodate.</p>
<h2>Previous events</h2>
<p>Here we will dump the details of previous events to allow visitors to get a feel for the kinds of in-person meetups we have. Events organised before the website was created (June 2018) are not included but can be found in the Facebook group.</p>
