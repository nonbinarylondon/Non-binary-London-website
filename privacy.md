## Privacy

You data is collected in the following ways:

This site uses cookies for analytics purposes via [Google Analytics](https://www.google.co.uk/analytics). This is so we can see where people come from when they arrive at the site and what they do while theyâ€™re here. This means Google has access to the analytics data as well as us.

This site is hosted by [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) so visiting the site will generate some web logs at their end, likely containing your IP address.

Our contact form is powered by [Formspree](https://formspree.io) and our mailing list by [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/), so their privacy policies apply if you use either form.
