<p class="before-list">Non-binary London exists to create and enable spaces both online and in person for non-binary people in London to connect with each other. This connection could be for any number of reasons, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>socialising;</li>
  <li>support;</li>
  <li>organising and/or promoting events, activities and activism;</li>
  <li>discussing issues;</li>
  <li>more broadly getting to know other non-binary people with a connection to the city.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on what the group is, who it's for and who'd behind it can be found on the <a href="/about">about</a> page.</p>

<h2>Join us!</h2>
<p class="before-list">You can join the group in a couple of ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nonbinarylondon" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>;</li>
  <li>our mailing list (coming very soon).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our mailing list is a new feature (as of June 2018) intended as an alternative way of keeping informed of upcoming "official" meetups for those not on Facebook. It is not intended to replicate the active online discussion community that the Facebook group has become.</p>
