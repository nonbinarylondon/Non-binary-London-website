<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p class="before-list">Non-binary London exists to create and enable spaces both online and in person for non-binary people in London to connect with each other. This connection could be for any number of reasons, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>socialising;</li>
  <li>support and solidarity;</li>
  <li>organising and/or promoting events, activities and activism;</li>
  <li>discussing issues;</li>
  <li>more broadly getting to know other non-binary people with a connection to the city.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on what the group is, who it's for and who's behind it can be found on the <a href="/about">about</a> page.</p>

<h2>Join us and keep informed of events</h2>
<p>There are a few different ways you can join the group and/or keep infomed of events, as detailed below. Our mailing list and Twitter profile are new features (as of June 2018) intended as alternative ways of keeping informed of upcoming "official" meetups for those not on Facebook. They are not intended to replicate the active online discussion community that the Facebook group has become.</p>
